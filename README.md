Using pandas to perform dataframe manipulations


Analysis:
After the manipulation of the data, three trends are apparent.

First, males contribute significantly more to total profits than females,
even though their average purchase is less than that of females and other.

Second, the largest age group in purchasers is 20-24, which is also significantly higher than 
the second highest age group.

Third, repeat purchases are unlikely. A vast majority of the users who made a purchase made only one.
The maximum profit for a single user was just over $50, and that is significantly higher than the average.
